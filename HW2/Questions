QUESTIONS:

2) peanoplus
   Invariant: peanoplus will always run y times regardless of x 
              because the method and if-statements depend on y.
   Big O = O(n)

3) peanotimes
   Big O = O(n)

8) binomial
   (choose 4 k) produces the 4th row in Pascal's triangle, i.e. binomial(4).
   Simply put, (choose n k) produces the kth element from the nth row of Pascal's triangle.
